# Altis_Insurgency_2021

This mission is an update to my previous Insurgency style mission with added air threats. Hope you enjot it!

Insurgency style mission complete with all the tools you need for a full MILSIM experience.
This is a unique experience, the 1st edition of the mission and is a rolling release. This mission is designed for a multiplayer environment on a dedicated server, however you can also enjoy it in single player. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
